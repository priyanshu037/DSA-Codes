/*
Given a matrix of size n*n, Print sum of diagonal element.
 Ex:    1 2 3
        4 5 6
        7 8 9

Its answer: 1+5+9 , 3+5+7, So the total sum will be 1+5+9+3+5+7 = 30. Here we can see that 5 is included 2 times, so we should include it only 1 time so the final answer will be, 30-5 = 25.  So the final answer will be 25.
